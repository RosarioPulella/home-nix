## Firefox
Got my extentions, had to enable them in ff though.
Want to build my extentions from source, ?and have the sources update with niv like everything else?
I still want no script...

Got an update tool to update the sources from moz, I am using those sources in nix and installing them on home-manager switch.

But I am not getting them from the source repos. I am getting compled packages from moz.
